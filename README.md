# Reservo

Welcome to **Reservo** the Booking & Reservation System sample/reference project, demonstrating the power of the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) design approach. This project serves as a practical companion to our comprehensive blog post on CQRS implementation.

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, addressing the growing complexity of modern systems is an ongoing challenge. One of the key hurdles faced by software architects and engineers is the efficient handling of commands and queries within an application. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as systems scale to accommodate larger user bases and increasing workloads.

The Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) design pattern has emerged as a powerful solution to address this challenge. By distinctly separating the responsibilities of command execution and query retrieval, CQRS offers a structured approach to building high-performance, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

Our Booking & Reservation System is a tangible example of the transformative impact that CQRS can have on software architecture. In this project, we delve into the need and benefits of adopting the CQRS design pattern, showcasing its practical implementation within a real-world scenario.

In the following sections, we will explore the core components of our project, each designed to illustrate the advantages of CQRS. From the BookingApp providing lightning-fast query capabilities to the ReservationService handling commands efficiently, and the EventCatalog offering a comprehensive view of the domain events, this project provides a holistic understanding of how CQRS can elevate the design and performance of your software systems.
This project showcases a Booking & Reservation System built using CQRS principles. Our goal is to provide a clear and practical example of how to implement CQRS in a real-world scenario.

## Project Structure

This monorepo is organized into several components, each contributing to the overall system:

1. **BookingApp**: This is the main application responsible for handling booking and reservation commands. It's built using [your favorite tech stack], and it showcases how to design a CQRS-based command side of the system.

2. **ReservationService**: This standalone service focuses on queries and managing reservations. It demonstrates the query side of CQRS.

3. **EventCatalog**: An essential part of CQRS is the event catalog. This application describes the domain events used throughout the system and provides a central reference for event types and their structures.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/booking-reservation-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project root directory:

   ```shell
   cd booking-reservation-system
   ```

3. Set up and start each component separately by following the instructions in their respective README files (`BookingApp/README.md`, `ReservationService/README.md`, and `EventCatalog/README.md`).

4. Explore the code, experiment, and learn from the implementation to understand how CQRS is applied in each part of the system.

## Features

- **CQRS Implementation**: This project demonstrates a complete implementation of CQRS, separating command and query responsibilities effectively.

- **Scalability**: Learn how CQRS can help your system scale efficiently by isolating read and write operations.

- **Event Sourcing**: Explore event sourcing as a data storage mechanism to maintain a history of changes.

- **Monorepo Structure**: Discover how to organize a monorepo for a multi-component project like this.

## Scripts

The root of this monorepo contains a set of npm scripts to help you manage and work with the individual components. Below is a list of these scripts along with their descriptions:

| Script             | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm run:catalog` | Run the repo EventCatalog application. |

Each of these scripts can be executed from the root directory of the monorepo and will apply the specified action to all relevant components. Refer to the individual component README files for more component-specific scripts and instructions.
